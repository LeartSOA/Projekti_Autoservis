# MyCar
Android application for automobile service book

# Note!
This is my graduation thesis project. It implements car service book but it stores all the data locally. The code quality is low, but one day I may fix that :D, so for now the greater alternative to this app is MyCarPRO. It can be found here(https://github.com/valentinstoqnov/MyCarPRO) and it's the improved version of MyCar(this one). MyCarPRO's architecture is MVP(Model-View-Presenter) and the code looks better(I guess :D). What's more is that it uses Firebase Database and Authentication due to the ability of accessing stored data from different devices.


Run: to run the app you should clone the repository and import the project in Android Studio
Then simply connect your Android smartphone to your computer via USB cable or start a virtual one
After you did that click run in the IDE and the app should start
